/// @title PaymentDelegate Contract
/// @author Joseph Reed
/// @dev The PaymentDelegate has a list of trusted payment schedulers with permission to add payments to user's accounts.
///      The PaymentDelegate can be centralized so more advanced payment types can be added efficiently and have the 
///      option to make it more decentralized later, or a user can control their own Payment Delegate and be responsible 
///      for updating it themselves. If using a personal Payment Delegate, the user must send the address of the 
///      PaymentDelegate to the recipient for them to know about the payment.
