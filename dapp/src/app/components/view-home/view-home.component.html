		<h2>Welcome to the Everchain Alarm Clock Manager (Kovan Testnet)</h2>
		
		<p>
		    Create automatic, on-chain, recurring alarm clocks to execute arbitrary smart contract functions. To fork this repo visit the <a href="https://github.com/everchain-project/recurring-alarm-clock" target="_blank">Everchain Alarm Clock</a> github page.
		</p>

		<h3>Provided Delegates</h3>
		<ul fxLayout="row">
			<li fxFlex="50">
				<b>Decentralized Payment Delegate</b><br>
				The Payment Delegate allows any delegate to schedule a payment with their respective wallet. The Payment Delegate must also be set as a delegate of the wallet for the payment to function.
			</li>
			<li fxFlex="50">
				<b>Alarm Clock Deployer</b><br>
				The Alarm Clock Deployer allows any delegate of a wallet to create a recurring alarm clock and schedule it with a provided payment delegate. The Alarm Clock Deployer must also be a delegate of the wallet to function.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Setup</h3>
		<ol>
			<li> You need an Ethereum Wallet with a kovan ether balance. If you don't have Kovan ether <a href="https://faucet.kovan.network/" target="_blank">click here</a> (github account required). 
			<li>
				Deploy a Delegated Wallet funded with Kovan ether. Deploying the Delegated Wallet automatically assigns you, the Decentralized Payment Delegate, and the Alarm Clock Deployer as a delegate of the wallet.
			</li>
			<li>
				After you deploy a wallet, create your first Alarm Clock by clicking the <mat-icon>alarm_add</mat-icon> button. When it is finished deploying it will automatically show up under "Active Alarms". As long as the Delegated Wallet has enough funds your Alarm Clocks will continue to function. The Alarm Clock can be cancelled, rescheduled, or destroyed at any time by a wallet delegate.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Alarm Cost</h3>

		<code class="centered">
			alarm cost = gas cost * current network gas price * safety multiplier
		</code>
		
		<p>
			The <a href="https://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360002703591-Why-does-Bancor-set-a-maximum-gas-price-" target="_blank">current network gas price</a> is set by the Bancor network. The Bancor Network needs a maximum gas price to prevent front running but still execute within 5 minutes. When a new alarm calculates it's cost, it repurposes this value as the best current gas price.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Alarm Cost Safety Multiplier is a temporary measure to ensure in the event of a drastic price drop or spike in gas costs, the alarm will still have enough funds to execute. In the future, a new delegate can be created that funds alarms <i>at the time of execution</i> and removes the need for an oracle. In addition, the new delegate enables <i>paying in any desired ERC20 token</i> such as Dai.
